# Documentation

This is an API built to combine and return external endpoints.

There is still room for improvement to make the functions more robust. As this is assumed to be only for development purposes, user authentication, authorization, error logging, and exception handling are not included.

In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of performance testing, two methods are provided for combining lists. Postman and https://dotnetfiddle.net/ were used for testing. Please feel free to ask questions and share your thoughts!
